# Announcing Hypergraph Adjacency Tensor Preview

To announce an exploration of hypergraphs using tensors, available in our GitHub [repo](https://github.com/thetensor-space/Hypergraphs).

A reference page for the Hypergraph Toolkit: a small library for studying the adjacency tensors of hypergraphs. This code is written in [Magma](https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/). More work needs to be done to implement this in python or other commonly used languages.
