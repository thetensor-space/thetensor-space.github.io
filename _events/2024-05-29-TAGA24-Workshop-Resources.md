I am a Professor of Mathematics at Bucknell University, where I teach a range of courses including discrete mathematics and abstract algebra. I am also a Co-Director of the Dominguez Center for Data Science at Bucknell. I have research interests in computational algebra, discrete geometry, and multilinear algebra.

<b>About this lecture series:</b> These lectures concern the application of linear methods to tensor analysis. The ways in which linear methods are used in tensor theory are, of course, too numerous to list. However, these lectures focus on invariants of a tensor that can be computed as solutions of linear systems, and that possess an algebraic structure that can effectively be used to reveal corresponding structure in the tensor. The lectures will include some short software demos using the Magma system.

<b>Lecture 1 (Centroids)</b> As well as providing an overview of the lecture series as a whole, the first lecture studies in detail an algebraic invariant of a tensor called the <i>centroid</i>. We will introduce the centroid as a generalized collection of scalars for the tensor, and we will see how it can be used to block-diagonalize a tensor. 

<b>Lecture 2 (Adjoints)</b> This lecture introduces another collection of scalars 
associated with a tensor: its ring of <i>adjoints</i>. We will discuss how adjoints can be used to reduce search spaces when testing for isomorphism between tensors. We will also develop some of the algebraic properties of the adjoint ring, and explain how to use these to discover other types of block decompositions in a tensor.

<b>Lecture 3 (Applications)</b> In the last lecture we will survey some applications and variations of the concepts and methods in lectures 1 & 2. For instance, we will look at bimaps arising from <i>p</i>-groups that come with additional symmetries, and consider how to adapt our linear invariants to this new setting. We will also see how to apply linear techniques to restricted isomorphism problems and to certain group intersection problems.
