## Activities

- Hikes! [Poudre Canyon](https://pwv.org/trails/all-trails) has trails of every length. A car is needed to reach those trails. For a trail accessible in town, take the 2 bus and get off at Prospect & Overland. The [Hike to the A](https://trails.colorado.gov/routes/29939) trail starts across the street.

- Breweries! [New Belgium](https://www.newbelgium.com/) and [Odell](https://www.odellbrewing.com/) are the most well known. Closer to campus are [Prost Brewing](https://www.prostbrewing.com/fort-collins-tap-room), [Tap and Handle](https://tapandhandle.com/), and [Mayor of Old Town](https://themayorofoldtown.com/).

- [Old Town!](https://downtownfortcollins.com/) It's a walking area with lots of cafes, shops, and restaurants. 

Tentatively, we plan on organizing a hike on either Saturday or Sunday, followed by some drinks/snacks at one of the bigger breweries.
